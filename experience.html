			<p>"I was one of the selected students to represent UiTM Kelantan Branch in the Student Volunteer Mission program to Sabah <br>under the Student Volunteer Foundation (Yayasan Sukarelawan Siswa),  which operates under the Ministry of National Unity. <br> This experience was both one of the most challenging and the most unforgettable moments of my life.

			<br> We were gathered from all over Malaysia with a shared purpose—to <b> make an impact on the community </b>. <br> After two weeks of perseverance and dedication to completing our mission, Alhamdulillah, it became a reality. <br> Now, I stand alongside other alumni, carrying the badge number <b> YSS1790 </b> with pride.  

			<br> With this, I embark on a new mission—to bring back and share the knowledge I have gained, ensuring it reaches the places where it is truly needed. <br> "No matter how far I go in pursuit of knowledge, UiTM Kelantan Branch will always be the place I return to."

			<p>"This photograph represents a crucial milestone in my path as the Secretary for the Campus Election Chair during Semester 3 of my diploma studies,<br> a position I maintained for one and a half years. As a member of the leadership team,<br> I was instrumental in ensuring that UiTM Kelantan's student elections proceeded smoothly and transparently. <br> Our efforts resulted in an amazing voter turnout, with Kelantan having the highest voting rate at 91%.<br> This experience helped me improve my leadership, collaboration, and organisational abilities,<br> allowing me to make a real contribution to student governance while working with a devoted team."</p>

			<p>Ten students from the prime mover club volunteered for the stateroom fair collectibles program <br> hosted by the Office of Industry, Community, and Alumni Network (ICAN), and external collaboration was formed in line with UiTM's 25th anniversary.<br>This presentation was conducted at the Grand Riverview Hotel and was well-received by Kelantan tourists. <br> This program was also present, and the Honourable Tengku Abdul Halim Al Haj Ibni Almarhum Sultan Ibrahim Tengku Laksamana Kelantan served as the principal officiant for it. <br></p>

			<p>In the midst of exploring the world of volunteering, the most important thing is not forgotten,<br> which is to complete industrial training at the Land and Colony Office, Kelantan (PTJTM) here.<br> Even though it was only for two months, that time provided a wealth of lessons and new knowledge for the workplace. <br> This reveals to us that having studies is one of the most important aspects of navigating the harsh world of adulthood.<br> Alhamdulillah, all of the cops there were quite friendly to me.</p>

			<p>This photo represents a crucial milestone in my tenure as President of the Campus Election Chair during Semester 5 of my diploma studies. <br> Leading the election process at UiTM Kelantan was both difficult and gratifying, necessitating careful organisation, collaboration, and strong leadership. <br>

			As a critical part of the leadership team, I was responsible for ensuring that the election process was fair, transparent, and efficient. <br> We achieved an amazing voter turnout thanks to our combined efforts, with UiTM Kelantan achieving an incredible 96% participation rate—a significant increase from 91% the previous session. <br> This success represents not just our students' devotion, but also our team's dedication to establishing a culture of active student involvement and democratic participation.
			<br>

			This experience dramatically changed my leadership, cooperation, and organisational abilities, <br> enabling me to handle problems, encourage collaboration, and make important contributions to student governance. <br> It was an honour to collaborate with such a passionate and committed team, all working towards a common goal of amplifying student voices and building our campus community. </p><br>

			<p>The program, "international volunteering program series 2: Let's stand together with prime mover UITM Kelantan branch x Universitas Utara Sumatra Medan Indonesia," <br> required nine prime mover club delegates to travel to Indonesia while still serving as our President of the Campus Election Chair.<br> Five external collaborations were also involved. This is my second overseas program;  it is an easy thing because I have three programs coming up soon.<br> 
			We are exposed to the culture, customs, and traditional cuisine of Indonesia through our concentration<br> on digital marketing in the mangrove love coal and your Dali Serdang market. <br> We also got to know Chinese and Thai students who participated in the program, in addition to Indonesians.<br>

			<p>In order to give us a firsthand look at the village's culture, we were split up into 11 host families, each of whom had two participants.<br> Making traditional "wau" kites, touring a serunding factory to discover how it is made, and engaging in net fishing were some of our activities. <br> In addition, we participated in a CSR project to clean the village mosque, presented a math program at Sekolah Rendah Integrasi Teras Islam Al-Furqan (SRITI) school, <br> and had fun engaging with the community in the evenings through a wayang kulit performance. <br> Through these activities, we developed deep relationships with the residents and deepened our awareness of the village's customs.<br>

			<p>With an emphasis on volunteerism and community service, the Ministry of Higher Education (KPT) founded the "Skuad Ihsan Madani" to promote compassion and solidarity. <br> Many public universities (IPTAs), including UniSZA, UMT, UPNM, UPM, UTEM, UTM, UPSI, UniMAP, and many more, <br> are involved in the flood relief mission in Kelantan, which is one of its primary initiatives. <br> Along with giving afflicted areas much-needed assistance, these initiatives improve cooperation and create enduring friendships and togetherness among students from different universities. <br></p>

			<p> On Sunday, January 5, 2025, Diploma information management, UiTM Cawangan Kelantan, and American Corner Kelantan (UMK) <br> organised "Empower Creativity: Canva & Microsoft for Beginnersa' - Tips & Tricks" at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Cherang Ruku, Pasir Puteh, Kelantan. <br> The event's goal was to give attendees a foundational understanding of Canva and Microsoft Office <br> through useful tips and techniques to boost creativity and efficiency, with guest speaker Ts. Mohd Zafian Mohd Zawawi.  <br> I entered this program as a secretary, but I will be serving as the program director for the other two this semester.<br> I was able to contribute to a class program that strives for outstanding grades while making a lasting impression, which was a meaningful way to end my diploma journey. <br>
